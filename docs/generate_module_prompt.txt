You are a senior Python software architect and module developer.

Your task is to implement a new, well-structured module based on the provided blueprint. Follow the requirements precisely while ensuring code quality, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

Blueprint Reference:
[Include the entire content from ddl_create.txt here]

Implementation Requirements:

1. Code Structure:
- Write clean, well-documented Python code with type hints
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include comprehensive docstrings for all public functions/classes
- Organize code with logical sections and clear separation of concerns

2. Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling with meaningful error messages
- Avoid silent failures - log errors appropriately
- Validate inputs and raise appropriate exceptions for invalid states
- Follow Python's EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) principle where appropriate

3. Dependencies:
- Use only standard library modules and pandas as specified in the blueprint
- Maintain compatibility with the existing external dependencies mentioned
- Don't introduce new external dependencies unless absolutely necessary

4. Performance Considerations:
- Optimize for readability and maintainability first
- Consider efficiency for typical use cases
- Handle large DataFrames reasonably well

5. Testing Considerations:
- Design functions to be easily testable
- Include clear contracts and predictable behavior
- Avoid global state where possible

6. Security Considerations:
- Prevent SQL injection by properly escaping identifiers
- Validate all inputs to prevent malicious use
- Follow secure coding practices

Additional Instructions:
- Start with imports and constants as shown in the blueprint
- Implement helper functions before main functions that depend on them
- Ensure the public API matches exactly what was specified in the blueprint
- Maintain the same function signatures and behaviors as described
- Pay special attention to database-specific handling as outlined in the blueprint
- Include the same type of logging mechanisms mentioned in the blueprint

Output Requirements:
- Generate a complete, runnable Python module
- Include all necessary imports, constants, functions, and classes
- Ensure the module is self-contained and ready for integration
- Add comments where implementation details require clarification
- Follow the same organization structure as outlined in the blueprint
